# Takeaways:
1. Purpose
I think this question evaded me the longest when I was first creating a website. It's one thing to have your name associated with a domain URL, but it's another to create an effective site with a functioning purpose. 

My very first attempt to create a website, I set up the HTML and was about to start typing up the page content when it hit me: "what is the page content even supposed to be?" 

I realized that in my mind, I had envisioned my website as a way for employers to know more about my achievments and projects. But isn't that what a resume is for? 

Flash forward to today, I keep my resume as a resume, and I use my website as a place to store my inner thoughts. People who want to learn more about me and what I do can easily find that information and I love sharing it. 

2. KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid)
Don't compare your website design or idea to other people who've had more experience and attemps to perfect their design. Start with a simple concept that visually appeals to your personal brand and the content you want to put on your website. 

Trying to create a website as you go is tricky. I found myself constantly losing motivation pumping out html and code without a clear direction ahead of me. For this most recent website, I used Figma to clearly lay out the website's ideal state before I attempted to even start writing any code.
