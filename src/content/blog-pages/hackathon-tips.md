I just want to start with a disclaimer: I'm by no means a pro or master at hackathons. In fact, I'm not even the biggest fan of attending them in the first place. You are put in a time-constrained situation which forces you to think and perform under pressure. Pulling an all nighter to pump out code is something I was excited to do in first year university, but a little so now that I am already well into my fourth year.

That being said, there are also countless benefits to these events. Quick reasons why you should attend one

- you can end up with a project you put in your portfolio!
- hackathons really force you to learn new tools and ideas quickly
- networking opportunities to meet some really cool people (more on this later)
- bragging rights

1. Make sure you have a goal heading in

   It can be important to do a little bit of self reflection before choosing to commit time to a hackathon. Ask yourself the following questions:

   * What do I want to get out of this experience?
   * Do I want to win, or learn, or just have fun?
   * Who do I want to do this hackathons with (got a group of friends, or want to meet new people?)


2. Preparation is key

   Here are some more questions to help organize yourself. 

   What technologies am I/my group familiar with?

   What kind of end product are within the scope of my abilities?

   There are tons of options of things you can create for a hackathon

   * website/web application
   * desktop application
   * mobile app (iOS, Android)
   * browser extension
   * discord/slack bot
   * machine learning model
   * product prototype

   I distinctly remember one past experience during my first 24 hour hackathon. Teammates in my group were desperately trying to set up a web server using Python Flask. It took us around six hours to get a bug-free server running for our hackathon project. However when I went home and sat down to learn Flask, I realized that if I had invested just a few hours before the hackathon, I probably could have helped my group get to their end goal much faster. Just a little bit of time to prepare your knowledge and understanding of technologies you think will be helpful in a hackathon can go a long way. 

3. Attend hackathons that are interesting to you. 

   I am always frustrated when fellow students come up to me and get scared about having to go to a "hackathon". I think one aspect of hackathons that beginners often overlook is that there are so many types out there. Yes, there are hackathons that focus on modern and trending technologies like blockchain or machine learning, but there are also so many more! One of the beauties of hackathons is that there is probably one tailored to your interests and skill level. 

   Different types of hackathons:

   * **Ideation Challenges** (not exactly a Hackathon, but close enough): where you are not expected to implement anything, but rather develop and pitch an idea or new product.
   * **Company Hackathons** - Here's a well-known secret: hackathons are a cheap and effective way for companies to find talented and driven individuals. Why spend tons of money searching for potential candidates, when you can have talented individuals sign up and basically filter themselves out with their creations?
   * **Themed Hackathons** - are you passionate about issues that affect the yourself, your community, or the world? You can probably find hackathons for just about any topic: accessibility, environmentalism, social impact, mental health, and more! 

4. Leverage different tools

   There are so many different technologies you can leverage to help build your project. Not everything has to (or should be) built from scratch. 

   #### APIs (Application Program Interfaces)

   Require data or a service provided by another company? Look at some public APIs you can leverage. Organizations often allow people to communicate with their services. They put the specifications of how to leverage their tools through APIs. The Google Maps API allows you to import map visualizations into just about any project. If you are in Vancouver like I am, our major bus servicer Translink has a public API where you can pull real-time bus updates. 

   #### Cloud

   Require a database, virtual machine, or a server for your application? You can leverage the services of major cloud providers like AWS, Azure, GCP to provide you with any resources you need. Most hackathons get endorsements or sponsorships from these companies. See if you can get your hands on free credits that can go into your project. 

   #### Low Code-No Code 

   Being able to code out projects in Java, Javascript, or Python is amazing. However, I think too many students get hung up over what they can't do, rather than look for options they can use. There are some amazing platforms out there for the purpose of creating applications without needing the complexities of code. Not only are these options often simple to use, but they can often create prototype applications much faster than traditional programming. Rather than spend hours trying to get visual layouts right using CSS/SCSS, you can drag and drop visual elements onto an application instead. 

   Some great options that I would recommend looking into if coding is not your thing:
   * Microsoft Power Apps
   * AirTable (alternative to setting up databases)
   * Bubble
   
   #### Wireframes

   Figma is one of the most versatile tools I've ever used. It's often used for creating visual designs or mockups of applications. However, you can actually get pretty close to simulating apps. By chaining "interactions" between different Figma objects you create, you can take viewers along a sample user flow. Of course you won't be able to include any background logic behind a Figma prototype, but if the hackathon just asks for a video submission, then just a visual wireframe is more than enough!

5. Don't just code, enjoy the experience

   I have tons of respect for hackathon directors. It's often more than just a competition. Oftentimes I see hackacthons with networking sessions, company boothing, coding or technology tutorials, or social events. If you want to get the full experience of a hackathon, I highly recommend you pull yourself away from your development screens and venture out to socialize!

What is the takeaway from all these tips? Well at the end of the day, all I can say about hackathons is quite useless until you experience one! If you are hesitant or unsure where to start, take a look at [MLH (Major League Hacking)](https://mlh.io). They help organize hackathons for just about every week in the year.
