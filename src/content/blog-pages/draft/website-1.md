For a student thinking of heading into the tech industry, it's only natural that I get myself a website right? That's something I'd been telling myself for the past three years. Now after about three different attempts at coding a site for myself, I am finally at a place where I am satisfied with my current creation...for now. I figure that it might be useful for me to document some of my challenges along the way in case a random reader happens to encounter the same issues. 

# Takeaways:
1. Purpose
I think this question evaded me the longest when I was first creating a website. It's one thing to have your name associated with a domain URL, but it's another to create an effective site with a functioning purpose. 

My very first attempt to create a website, I set up the HTML and was about to start typing up the page content when it hit me: "what is the page content even supposed to be?" 

I realized that in my mind, I had envisioned my website as a way for employers to know more about my achievments and projects. But isn't that what a resume is for? 

Flash forward to today, I keep my resume as a resume, and I use my website as a place to store my inner thoughts. People who want to learn more about me and what I do can easily find that information and I love sharing it. 

2. Keep your expectations realistic and work your way up
You know what I think my biggest regret when first trying to make a website? I based off my inspiration from [this](https://brittanychiang.com). A gorgeous site made using Gatsby/React.js. At the time, for a second year student who just started learning the intricacies of CSS flexbox (not even grid), I set the bar for myself too high. 

While I am currently using Gatsby, the learning curve definitely took a long time to overcome. I attempted and gave up multiple times trying to learn the intricacies of Gatsby and React before I finally found my groove. I wouldn't say it was a matter of finding the perfect resource in helping me overcome my plateau, but rather pure persistence. Sometimes it just takes a small break and a fresh perspective before everything clicks into place. 

3. KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid)
I think part of the reason why it was so difficult to implement a site is that I tend to overthink when I build. I can be working on a navbar, but in my mind I'm trying to figure out how to create a splash animation. I found that breaking down the development of the site into atomic parts allowed me to focus on specific sections. The component structure of React definitely helped in allowing me to breakdown complex parts of the site like the blog into simpler pieces. 

I also coded parts of the website in smaller, shorter bursts. Rather than try to learn/implement everything in one go, I scheduled and organized my workflow to spread out the workload. I spent an entire afternoon focussing specifically on GraphQL and another trying to understand CSS modules and best practices. 

4. Plan first, design second

 For this current iteration, I started with a simple concept. Trying to create a website as I went was also tricky. I found myself constantly losing motivation pumping out code without a clear direction ahead of me. For this most recent website, I used Figma to clearly lay out the website's ideal state before I even attempted to start writing any code. 

My site is in no way close to completion. I still have a checklist of items I need to address:
- [ ] responsive design for mobile
- [ ] a PROJECTS page in conjunction with the blog
- [ ] a detailed ABOUT ME page
